# NOTE

I'm abandoning this project in favor of other projects.
Also there are a few things I regret about how I went about this,
so I'll probably start over again some time under different conditions.

## MP3 Player

This is my attempt at building an MP3 Player from scratch, to expand my knowledge in low level operations,
signal processing, PCB and circuit design, as well as embedded systems in general.

I'm currently working on the software to test it all on a raspberry pi first, after that I'll attempt
to design the hardware and port the software to whatever I came up with.

This is just a fun side/hobby project that will probably take me a long time to finish, but I'm learning a lot.
